    *check lines that more likely to cause problems
    *small test case first, edge cases second, then bigger test cases.

BUD: 

- given two arrays find all elemens in common. (sorted and distinct)
[-10,5,19,35,46,47,55] and [8,19,30,34,35,37,47,59]
- anagram of a word (if a server its involved you may have a database, could do queries et.) .... can sort the words in a dictionary, then sort the given word and find in dictionary. 

- find the celebritity. (a person that everbody knows, but the person doesn't know anyone in the group) 
with each check eliminate someone. 
the one not eliminated gets checked against in the next iteration


- find biggest, smallest of something : 

- permutation problem. find all permutations of a string in another string
